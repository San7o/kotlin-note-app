# kotlin-note-app

## Project Statement

This project aims to build a simple note-taking app in kottin. I'm doing this
project for the purpose of learning kotlin and Android developement.

## Requirements

You must have `java21`, `kotlin` and `gradle` installed on your machine.
If you are on `NixOS`, you can run the following command to access the
developement shell:
```bash
nix-shell
```

The project uses `gradle` as a command-line interface for the application.
To build the project, run:
